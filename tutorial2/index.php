    <h1>Arrays, Classes, Inheritance and Multiple Files</h1>
    <p>Upon completing this tutorial, you should be able to do the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Work with indexed arrays.</li>
        <li>Work with associative arrays.</li>
        <li>Declare, instantiate, manipulate classes and objects.</li>
        <li>Use static functions and properties.</li>
        <li>Use class inheritance.</li>
        <li>Distribute code/logic across multiple PHP files and use them in your web site development.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Indexed arrays</h2>
    <p>Work in <a href="arrays.php">arrays.php</a>.<br>
        There are some predefined variables for you to use throughout this tutorial. They are:<br>
        $nums, $sentence and $people.<br>
        There are eight functions for you to fill in and complete.<br>
        Firstly, we will want to just loop over all the items in the array called $nums,<br />
        and print out every single number in that array and then add a break tag to the end of each line.</p>
